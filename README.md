# Photogallery
React photogallery with custom webpack

## Install
```
cd photogallery
```
```yarn``` or ```npm install```

## Run
```
yarn start
```

## Run test
```
yarn run test
```

Both parts of the assignment are in this repository - I created a webpack config that meets the requirements and used the same project to create the React app with a PhotoGallery component.
