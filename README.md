# Photogallery
React photogallery with custom webpack

## Install
```
cd photogallery
```
```yarn``` or ```npm install```

## Run
```
yarn start
```

## Run test
```
yarn run test
```

Both parts of the assignment are in this repository - I created a webpack config that meets the requirements and used the same project to create the React app with a PhotoGallery component. I used [react-swipe](https://github.com/voronianski/react-swipe) to build my component, unfortunately the touch swipe functionality is currently not working as referenced [here](https://github.com/voronianski/react-swipe/issues/158)
